# Welcome to Swift Draw!

This playground will give you some more practice with functions. We will review calling functions without parameter, calling functions with parameters, and calling functions that return a value.
 
 Along the way we will review some useful vocabulary including **algorithms**, **procedural abstractions**, **encapsulation**, and **sequencing**.
 
Make sure you turn on the **Live View**.  Click **Editor --> Live View** to turn on the Live View. You should have a new area of the editor that will display our results.
 
If you haven't already, run this playground page to see the outcome. You should see our Swift Draw bird waiting to draw our masterpiece.
 
Notice the call to the `startDrawing()` function below, this function is required to show the results of our algorithms. Turn to the next page to learn more functions and get some practice with Swift Draw.

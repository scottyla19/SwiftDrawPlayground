 ### Calling functions and using procedural abstraction to simplify complex tasks.
 
 Now we get to start learning how to have our bird draw objects for us. First, we need to know some functions that our bird can perform. The [Documentation](Documentation) page has a list of all the functions that the SwiftDraw bird can perform. For now, we will focus on `turnLeft()`, `turnRight()`, and `moveForward()`.
 
 - Experiment: Call the functions `turnLeft()`, `turnRight()`, and `moveForward()` to  see how the bird responds.

 Comment or delete all of the functions above.
 
 - callout(Excercise): Using only the three functions on this page, create an algorithm to draw a square on the screen.

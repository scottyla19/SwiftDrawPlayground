# Draw a house
### Encapsulate your algorithms from before to create a bird house
 
Now we are going to draw a house for our bird! Your goal is to make your drawing look similar to the one below. Make sure to place your bird in the house at the end.

 The good news is you have already created the algorithms in previous pages. Now we will encapsulate those steps into some useful functions.
 - callout(Exercise): Put in your algorithms from the [Draw a box page](Draw%20a%20box) into the body of the `drawBox()` function below.
 * Note:  if you want your side lengths to be different from the default 100.0 pixels, you may want to add the appropriate parameter in the `drawBox()` definition below.
 */
func drawBox(){
    
}
/*:
Thanks to the `drawBox()`function we now have the walls of our house! Next, we need to add a roof to our bird house. Now we will encapsulate the steps in our [Draw a triangle](Draw%20a%20triangle) algorithm to create our `drawRoof()` function.
 - callout(Exercise): Create your roof using the algorithm that you implemented to draw a triangle.
 * Note: You should add at least one parameter to the function so that our bird knows the pitch length of the roof. Are there any other parameters that `drawRoof()` could use?
 */
func drawRoof(/*parameters*/){
    
}
/*:
 Finally, lets help the bird move in to her new house.
 - callout(Exercise): Move the bird so that she is fully inside the house and make her beak face directly vertical.
 */
func moveInBird(){
    
}
/*:
 - callout(Exercise): Call your three functions to have the bird draw her house.
